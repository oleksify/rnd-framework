# JavaScript / TypeScript / CSS / HTML — KISS Rules

## JavaScript & TypeScript

- Use native APIs before reaching for packages — `fetch` over axios, `URL` over uri-parser, `structuredClone` over lodash.cloneDeep
- Don't add TypeScript generics when concrete types work — `function getUser(id: string): User` over `function get<T>(id: string): T`
- Don't create utility files for one-time helpers — inline the logic at the call site
- Don't add abstraction layers over `fetch` — a wrapper adds indirection without value until you need interceptors
- Don't add state management libraries for local component state — `useState` is enough until you measurably need shared state
- Don't create custom hooks for trivial effects — `useEffect` with a comment is clearer than `useDataFetcher`
- Use `async/await` over `.then()` chains — but don't add `try/catch` around every await unless you handle the error differently than letting it propagate
- Don't add barrel files (`index.ts` re-exports) until imports are genuinely painful
- Don't type every intermediate variable — let TypeScript infer

## CSS

- Use simple selectors — avoid BEM/SMACSS methodology unless the project already uses it
- Don't create CSS utility classes for one-off styles — inline styles or scoped classes are fine
- Use CSS custom properties for values used 3+ times, not for every color and spacing
- Don't add a CSS-in-JS library when a stylesheet works
- Flexbox and Grid solve most layouts — don't reach for layout libraries

## Tailwind CSS

- Use utility classes directly in markup — don't extract to `@apply` unless a pattern repeats 3+ times
- Don't create custom Tailwind plugins for one-off design tokens — use arbitrary values (`bg-[#1a1a2e]`) instead
- Don't add `@layer components` abstractions for single-use component styles
- Use Tailwind's built-in responsive prefixes (`md:`, `lg:`) — don't create custom breakpoint utilities
- Don't override Tailwind's spacing/color scales unless the project has a design system that conflicts
- Use `class:` conditional syntax (Svelte) or template literals over `clsx`/`classnames` for simple conditionals — reach for utility libraries only when conditional logic is genuinely complex

## HTML

- Use semantic HTML elements (`nav`, `main`, `article`, `section`) over `div` soup
- Don't add ARIA attributes that duplicate native semantics — a `<button>` doesn't need `role="button"`
- Don't create component abstractions for simple markup — a `<Card>` component wrapping a `<div>` with a class adds indirection for no reuse benefit until it appears 3+ times

## Polish

- Within a module, pick one naming convention for async functions and stick to it: `fetchUser` / `loadUser` — don't mix `fetch*`, `load*`, and `get*` for the same operation type
- Order exports by public surface first, unexported helpers at the bottom — readers should see the API before implementation details
- Comments should explain WHY the code makes a non-obvious choice — e.g., `// Safari 16 doesn't support X, so we use Y`; remove comments that just restate what the next line does
- Keep CSS class naming consistent within a component tree: if the project uses BEM, don't introduce utility-class-style names for one component
