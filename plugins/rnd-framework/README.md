# R&D Framework Plugin for Claude Code

A Claude Code plugin that applies the scientific method to software engineering. It replaces ad-hoc coding with structured pipeline orchestration built on principles drawn directly from scientific methodology. Supports two execution modes: **single-flow** (all phases sequential in one session) and **multi-agent** (specialized agents per pipeline phase with structural information barriers).

| Scientific Method | Framework Principle | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Hypothesis declaration | **Pre-registration** | Declare intent and testable success criteria before coding |
| Structured experimentation | **Decomposition** | Break tasks into hierarchical sub-tasks with paired verification |
| Blinded peer review | **Independent verification** | Separate verifier with strict information barriers |
| Reproducible evidence | **Evidence-based gates** | Quality checkpoints requiring reproducible evidence, not assertions |
| Dependency analysis | **Parallel scheduling** | Identify parallel vs sequential work for concurrent execution |

## Installation

Add the marketplace and install:

```
/plugin marketplace add https://tangled.sh/oleksify.me/claude-plugins
/plugin install rnd-framework@rnd-framework-plugins
```

Update to the latest version:

```
/plugin update rnd-framework@rnd-framework-plugins
```

### Inline declaration via settings.json (v2.1.80+)

Claude Code v2.1.80 added support for declaring plugins directly in `settings.json` without going through the marketplace. This is useful for local development or pinning a specific directory.

Add to `.claude/settings.json` (project-level) or `~/.claude/settings.json` (global):

```json
{
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "rnd-framework": {
      "source": "settings",
      "path": "./plugins/rnd-framework"
    }
  }
}
```

The `path` is resolved relative to the settings file's location. Use an absolute path if the plugin lives outside the project tree.

## Organization-Wide Seeding

For teams that want to pre-install the plugin across all machines, set `CLAUDE_CODE_PLUGIN_SEED_DIR` to a directory containing the plugin. Multiple seed directories can be separated by `:` (Unix) or `;` (Windows):

```bash
export CLAUDE_CODE_PLUGIN_SEED_DIR="/shared/plugins:/team/plugins"
```

Claude Code will discover and register plugins from all listed directories on startup.

## Per-Project Plugin Configuration

To control which plugins are active per-project, use Claude Code's `enabledPlugins` setting.

Add to your project's `.claude/settings.local.json` (not committed to git) or `.claude/settings.json` (shared with team):

```json
{
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "plugin-name@source": false
  }
}
```

### How settings precedence works

Settings are merged with more specific scopes winning:

1. **`.claude/settings.local.json`** (per-machine, not committed) — highest priority
2. **`.claude/settings.json`** (per-project, committed) — overrides user settings
3. **`~/.claude/settings.json`** (global) — fallback

Only plugins explicitly set to `false` at a more specific scope are disabled. Plugins not mentioned inherit from the parent scope.

### Verify active plugins

After configuring, start a Claude Code session in the project and check:
- The session should show `rnd-framework` in the startup context
- `/rnd-framework:rnd-status` should work

## Execution Modes

The framework supports two execution modes, selectable via `/rnd-framework:rnd-start`:

### Single-Flow Mode

All pipeline phases run sequentially in a single session. No agents are spawned — the session invokes skills directly for each phase. Best for quick iterations, smaller tasks, or environments where multi-agent overhead is undesirable.

```
Plan → Schedule → Build → Verify → Iterate? → Integrate
```

### Multi-Agent Mode

Specialized agents handle each pipeline phase in isolated context windows. The orchestrator dispatches work to agents, enforcing structural information barriers — agents literally cannot see each other's internal reasoning. Best for complex tasks requiring maximum verification rigor.

```
Plan → Schedule → Build → [Reality Audit] → [Proof Gate] → Verify → Iterate? → Integrate
```

Additional phases in multi-agent mode:
- **Reality Audit** — `rnd-reality-auditor` adversarially verifies external contracts (SQL schemas, API responses, env vars). Blocking — routes back to build on INVALID findings.
- **Proof Gate** — `rnd-proof-gate` attempts formal Lean 4 proofs of pre-registration criteria. Advisory — findings inform but don't block.

Use `/rnd-framework:rnd-start` for the full pipeline with mode selection.

## Commands

## Agents

Eight specialized agents for the multi-agent execution mode. All have persistent memory (`memory: user`), skills preloaded at startup, distinct UI colors, and KISS rules. The verifier has `disallowedTools: Edit` as defense-in-depth (Write is allowed for experiment files in `$RND_DIR` only).

| Agent | Model | Color | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| `rnd-framework:rnd-planner` | opus | blue | Decomposes tasks, writes pre-registration documents, builds dependency matrix |
| `rnd-framework:rnd-builder` | sonnet | green | Implements one task with TDD, produces build manifest + self-assessment |
| `rnd-framework:rnd-verifier` | opus | amber | Independent verification against pre-registered criteria with information barrier |
| `rnd-framework:rnd-integrator` | sonnet | purple | Merges verified outputs, runs integration/system tests, SHIP/NO-SHIP verdicts |
| `rnd-framework:rnd-debugger` | opus | orange | Reproduces bugs, identifies root causes, produces diagnosis report for Builder |
| `rnd-framework:rnd-proof-gate` | sonnet | pink | Attempts formal Lean 4 proofs of pre-registration criteria (advisory, non-blocking) |
| `rnd-framework:rnd-reality-auditor` | sonnet | teal | Adversarially verifies external service contracts (SQL, APIs, env vars) |
| `rnd-framework:rnd-data-scientist` | opus | cyan | Standalone specialist for numerical/analytical work, with optional Lean 4 specs |

In single-flow mode, agents are not spawned — the session invokes skills directly. In multi-agent mode, the orchestrator dispatches work to these agents, each running in its own context window with structural isolation.

## Pipeline Scaling

Every task goes through the pipeline, scaled to complexity:

| Complexity | Entry Point | What Happens |
|---|---|---|
| Bug (reported symptom) | `/rnd-framework:rnd-debug` | Debugger diagnoses → Builder fixes → Verifier confirms |
| Trivial to small | `/rnd-framework:rnd-start` | Single-flow: plan → build → verify inline |
| Medium (1-4hr) | `/rnd-framework:rnd-start` | Planner + N Builders + N Verifiers + Integrator |
| Large (multi-day) | `/rnd-framework:rnd-start` | Full pipeline + design review gate |
| High-stakes | `/rnd-framework:rnd-start` | Full pipeline + dual independent verification |

## Roadmapping (Multi-Session Tasks)

For tasks that span multiple days or sessions, use `/rnd-framework:rnd-roadmap` to decompose the work into milestones before starting any pipeline session.

```
> /rnd-framework:rnd-roadmap Add full authentication system with OAuth, RBAC, and audit logging
  [Planner decomposes into milestones and writes roadmap.md at the project base]
  [Shows milestone list with statuses]

> /rnd-framework:rnd-roadmap   # run again to continue
  [Identifies next NOT_STARTED milestone, transitions to IN_PROGRESS]
  [Routes to /rnd-framework:rnd-start with milestone scope]
```

**Milestone lifecycle:** `NOT_STARTED` → `IN_PROGRESS` → `DONE` (or `SKIPPED`)

Each milestone is one `/rnd-framework:rnd-start` session. After a SHIP verdict, the `rnd-completion` skill marks the milestone DONE and records the session ID. The `/rnd-start` command detects an existing roadmap in Phase 0 and scopes the session to the current milestone.

See the `rnd-roadmapping` skill for the roadmap.md format and update protocol.

## Typical Workflow

### Big feature

```
> /rnd-framework:rnd-start Add OAuth2 login with Google provider
  [Phase 0: Discovery — requirements gathering]
  [Phase 0.5: Design Exploration — 2-3 architectural alternatives with trade-offs, user approves design spec]
  [Planner produces task tree, pre-registrations, dependency matrix from approved design]
  [Review the plan, adjust if needed]

> /rnd-framework:rnd-build wave-1
  [Builder agents work on Wave 1 tasks in parallel]

> /rnd-framework:rnd-verify wave-1
  [Independent Verifier checks each task against criteria]

> /rnd-framework:rnd-build wave-2
  [...continues through waves...]

> /rnd-framework:rnd-integrate final
  [System validation, regression check, SHIP/NO-SHIP]
```

### Small task

```
> /rnd-framework:rnd-start Fix the race condition in token refresh
  [Plan → build → independent verify → done]
```

### Check progress

```
> /rnd-framework:rnd-status
```

## How Information Barriers Work

The Verifier never sees the Builder's self-assessment or reasoning. Enforcement varies by execution mode:

**Single-flow mode:**
1. **PreToolUse hook** — `read-gate.sh` blocks any Read call targeting files with `self-assessment` in the path
2. **Skill instructions** — the `rnd-verification` skill explicitly prohibits reading self-assessment files

**Multi-agent mode:**
1. **Structural isolation** — agents run in separate context windows, so the Verifier literally cannot see the Builder's internal reasoning
2. **PreToolUse hook** — same hook enforcement as single-flow (defense-in-depth)
3. **Agent instructions** — each agent's system prompt clearly states what it can and cannot access

Without this barrier:
- The Verifier gets anchored by the Builder's framing
- Known issues get "verified" as acceptable rather than caught
- Verification becomes rubber-stamping

## Project Artifacts

The framework stores pipeline artifacts in a centralized directory outside the project tree, computed by `lib/rnd-dir.sh`. The path is based on a hash of the git common directory (`git rev-parse --git-common-dir`, canonicalized), so each project gets its own isolated artifact space. All worktrees of the same repo share the same base directory. Falls back to `pwd` when not in a git repo.

**Helper script:** `lib/rnd-dir.sh`
- Called as `"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/lib/rnd-dir.sh"` from hooks and agents
- Outputs an absolute path like `~/.claude/.rnd/<dirname>-<hash>/sessions/<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-XXXX>`
- Use `-c` flag to create the directory structure on first use
- Use `--finish` to clear the session ID after a pipeline run
- Use `--base` to get the project base dir (without session path)

Each pipeline run gets a unique session ID. Previous sessions remain on disk and can be browsed with `/rnd-framework:rnd-history`.

**Artifact layout** (`$RND_DIR`):

```
~/.claude/.rnd/<dirname>-<hash>/         # Project base (dirname + 8-char hash of path)
├── .current-session                    # Active session ID
├── calibration.jsonl                   # Verdict accuracy tracking (cross-session); stored in CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA when set
└── sessions/
    └── <YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-XXXX>/         # One session per pipeline run
        ├── plan.md                     # Enriched plan: environment, testing strategy, worker guidelines, validation contract, pre-registrations, schedule
        ├── design-spec.md              # Approved architectural design spec (Design phase output)
        ├── diagnosis/
        │   └── T1-diagnosis.md         # Debugger's root cause analysis (debug pipeline only)
        ├── builds/
        │   ├── T1-manifest.md          # What the builder produced
        │   └── T1-self-assessment.md   # Builder's uncertainties (Verifier cannot read)

        └── iteration-log.md            # Build-verify cycle tracking
```

Since artifacts live outside the project directory, no `.gitignore` changes are needed.

## Output Styles

Three custom output styles optimized for R&D pipeline work. Source files live in `output-styles/` within the plugin.

| Style | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Scientific** | Hypothesis-driven reasoning — every change framed as experiment → evidence → conclusion |
| **Rigorous** | Maximum precision, zero ambiguity — explicit assumptions, rationale chains, audit-trail quality |
| **Pipeline** | Minimal narrative — structured status blocks, tables, next actions only |

### Registration

Output styles must be in `~/.claude/output-styles/` (user-level) or `.claude/output-styles/` (project-level) to appear in `/output-style`. Symlink from your project:

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/output-styles
ln -sf path/to/rnd-framework/output-styles/scientific.md .claude/output-styles/
ln -sf path/to/rnd-framework/output-styles/rigorous.md .claude/output-styles/
ln -sf path/to/rnd-framework/output-styles/pipeline.md .claude/output-styles/
```

Then switch with `/output-style scientific`, `/output-style rigorous`, or `/output-style pipeline`.

## Customization

### Change agent models

In each agent's YAML frontmatter, change the `model:` field:

- Planner: `opus` (strong reasoning for decomposition)
- Builder: `sonnet` (speed + quality for implementation)
- Verifier: `opus` (strong reasoning to catch subtle issues)
- Integrator: `sonnet` (mostly mechanical merge + test running)

### Adjust iteration budget

Edit the iteration limit in the `/rnd-framework:rnd-start` command (default: 3).

### Create new skills

Use the `writing-skills` skill for guidance on creating new skills that plug into the framework.

## Limitations

- **Hook enforcement is best-effort.** The PreToolUse hook blocks self-assessment reads but can't prevent indirect access (e.g., via inline code execution). Hook discipline is the primary enforcement.
- **No persistent state across sessions.** The `.rnd/` directory provides continuity, but session context resets. Use `/rnd-framework:rnd-status` to re-orient.
- **Token cost.** The full multi-agent pipeline (Planner + Builders + Verifiers + Integrator) is expensive. Use single-flow mode for smaller tasks.
- **Information barrier is path-based.** Hooks block reads of files with `self-assessment` in the path. The `read-gate.sh` hook checks the file path to prevent verification phases from reading build-phase reasoning.
